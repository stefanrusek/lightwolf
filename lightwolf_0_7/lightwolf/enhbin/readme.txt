This folder contains enhanced classes.
This should be in classpath in the place of the "bin" folder.
(Help wanted to develop a builder for Eclipse). 

Please use the file "launch/lightwolf build.xml.launch" to fill-up this folder.
You can use build.xml directly, but in this case you will have to put the "bin"
folder on Ant classpath.
