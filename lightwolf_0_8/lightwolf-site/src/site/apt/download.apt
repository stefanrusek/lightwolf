Downloading Light Wolf

    If you use Eclipse IDE 3.3 or later, the easiest way to download Light Wolf library is through
    the update site:

---
    http://lightwolf.sourceforge.net/updates/
---

    Choose the <<Light Wolf Plug-in>>, since it contains the Library. This plug-in comes with an
    Eclipse builder that enhances .class files automatically. Just add Light Wolf nature to a Java
    project using the project's context menu. This will also add the Light Wolf Library to the
    project's build path.

Non-Eclipse Users

    Sorry, not yet available.
    There is work in progress to create a binary distribution which includes the library and its
    dependencies.
