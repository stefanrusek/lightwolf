Installing Light Wolf Binaries

    Download the package

Installing Light Wolf on Eclipse

    This guide is based on Eclipse 3.3. Light Wolf was tested on Eclipse 3.4 and works, but the
    steps to download and install are a bit different, since this mechanism was changed on Eclipse
    3.4. Hence you should get no trouble to download and install on Eclipses newer than 3.3.

    First download and install the <<Light Wolf Plug-in>> for Eclipse from the following update
    site:

---
    http://lightwolf.sourceforge.net/updates/
---

    You can accomplish this by going to the Find and Install menu of Eclipse:

    Then you choose <<Search for new features to install>> and click on the <<New Remote Site...>>
    button. This will bring up a dialog box, on which you can type the following values:

    Once you clicked OK, check only the <<Light Wolf>> item on the list box, and then click
    <<Next>>. Wait for the server response and choose the Light Wolf Plug-in. There should be only
    one version available. Read and accept the license (if you want), wait for the download to
    finish, and restart Eclipse.

    Now that you are back on Eclipse, right-click on any Java project, and choose the <<Add/Remove
    Light Wolf Nature>> option:

    You should get a message about the success of this operation:

    Before you can play with utilities, check if the project builder page is listing the <<Light
    Wolf Builder>>. Such builder must always be the last builder in the list:

    Also check if the <<Light Wolf Library>> was added to the project's build path:

[images/eclipse-project-libraries.gif]

    If you accidentally remove this library, you can add it again by using the <<Add Library...>>
    button on that page.

    Now let's make the test. Create a new class and paste a sample from the
    {{{index.html}home page}}. Then you can run it as ay ordinary Java class. You can simply
    right-click the class in Eclipse's Package Explorer, and choose <<Run As>>, <<Java
    Application>>. If your choice for a sample was the {{{index.html#aForkMerge}fork/merge}}, you
    should be looking to something like this:

    That's all. Now you should be able to use Light Wolf utilities within your project's code.

Some Important Advice

    * This project is in early stages of development. It still in Alpha on SourceForge. If you
      find some bug, please post a "bug artifact" on Light Wolf's 
      {{{http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=241050}tracker}}.

    * If Eclipse reports an error message from Light Wolf Builder, this might be due to manual
      changes to .classpath file or .class files (not all possible changes are being detected by
      the Light Wolf Plug-in). If you perform a clean-up on all projects and rebuild, the build
      should be correct and the error should not appear on any subsequent builds.

    * Remember to use the {{{javadoc/org/lightwolf/FlowMethod.html}FlowMethod}} annotation!!! It is
      required to enhance the method so Light Wolf utilities can be invoked from it.
