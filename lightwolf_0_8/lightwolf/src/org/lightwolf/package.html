Core classes for flow manipulation and synchronization.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

This package contains the {@link org.lightwolf.Flow} class and the
{@link org.lightwolf.FlowMethod} annotation, which are used to build
flows in Java. A flow is very similar to a thread:
<ul>
	<li>Each flow have a stack frame, like a thread.
	<li>A flow, like a thread, can run Java methods. Such methods can
	be interpreted but also just-in-time compiled.
	<li>Flows can access heap objects. The heap space is the same used
	by threads. Flows and threads can shared such objects in a transparent
	way.
	<li>Flows can be suspended or interrupted.
</ul>
The following summarizes the differences between flows and threads:
<ul>
	<li>A flow can be suspended, have its state removed from memory,
	then restored to memory and then resumed, possibly on another JVM
	instance or machine.
	<li>When a flow is suspended, it does not consume a Java thread,
	and not even a system thread. This makes flows more friendly to
	thread-pools.
	<li>The {@link org.lightwolf.Flow} is a final class. To create a
	flow, one must write and call a {@link org.lightwolf.FlowMethod
	flow-method}.
</ul>
